# Database

Since Speedtest Tracker is built on the Laravel Framework any of the framework's supported database [drivers](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/database#configuration) are also supported.

MySQL/MariaDB ships as the default driver but you can also use SQLite and Postgres. While SQL Server is supported by Laravel it hasn't been tested with Speedtest Tracker so no support will be provided for that driver.
